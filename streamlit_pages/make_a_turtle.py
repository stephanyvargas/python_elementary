    # Fun Explanation
    st.write("""
        **Did you know?** Colors on screens are made by mixing three colors: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**!
        Each color can have a strength from **0** (completely off) to **255** (the brightest possible).
        When we change the strength of red, green, or blue, we create new colors!

        Try moving the sliders below and watch how the color changes.
        - If you set **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** to the same number, you get a shade of gray.
        - Setting **Red** to 255 and **Green** and **Blue** to 0 gives you a pure red color.
        - Mixing full **Red** and **Green** but no **Blue** gives you **Yellow**!

        Can you make your favorite color by adjusting the sliders? ðŸŽ¨
